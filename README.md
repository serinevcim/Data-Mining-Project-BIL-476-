- data_collecting: collecting the artwork data from wikiarts website in an excel,
- data_exploration: exploration of the tabular data of artworks (according to the time/time period, media, genre...),
- image_gathering: gathering some of the artwork's images from the link that collected in the excel, and saved into personal google drive,
- image_analyze: analyzing the artwork images (according to the color...)
